Here be dragons - this is very much a work in progress.

Take a series of plugins and versions, and print out a Hiera-compatible list of
plugins and versions to use, with all transitive dependencies resolved.
Intended to be used with the Jenkins Puppet module.

Rough steps involved in the implementation:

1. Read in input YAML file.
2. Gather metadata from plugins.
   1. Resolve dependencies.
   2. Recurse.
3. Print results.
